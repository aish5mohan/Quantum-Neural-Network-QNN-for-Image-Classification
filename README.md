# Quantum-Neural-Network-QNN-for-Image-Classification
A Quantum Neural Network (QNN) is a machine-learning model that uses quantum circuits instead of classical layers to learn patterns from data. For image classification, the input image is first preprocessed and encoded into quantum states using techniques like angle encoding or amplitude encoding.
